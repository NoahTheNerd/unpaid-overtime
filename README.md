<hr>

Ever wanted to have a longer story mode for Rhythm Doctor, without going through the tedious process of moving .dll files? [Unpaid Overtime](https://NoahTheNerd.github.io/unpaid-overtime) is fanmade bonus content for Rhythm Doctor that aims to add new content

## Installation
Haha, just kidding. You don't have to do any installing. Just head over to [the website](https://NoahTheNerd.github.io/unpaid-overtime) and get playing. You need a copy of [Rhythm Doctor](https://rhythmdr.com) and that's all. Make sure to turn off Windows Ransomware Protection, as it causes issues with loading custom levels.
